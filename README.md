# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside of its valid index range, resulting in this exception.  The `Solution.java` file shows how to fix the problem by ensuring that array access is within the bounds of the array.

This exception is often caused by off-by-one errors or using incorrect loop conditions.  Understanding and avoiding this is crucial for writing robust Java applications.
